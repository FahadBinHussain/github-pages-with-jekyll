Introduction

NOTICE TO THE READER

You are under no obligation whatever to read a single word of this introduction.

                                                                                                                    - FAHAD BIN HUSSAIN


I SEEM TO BE constantly introducing something. For years I’ve been introducing my stories. I’ve introduced my sites. And I’ve introduced books of mystery, ghost and suspense stories for my friends to shiver with.
  
  Now I find myself introducing a trio of lads who call themselves The Legends, and play football at 7 in the morning, taking bath in the pond, having every kind of fun you can ever imagine of, and studying 28 hours a day! Preposterous, isn’t it?

  Frankly I would prefer to have nothing to do with these three youths, but I rashly promised to introduce them. And I am a man of my word—even though the promise was extorted from me by nothing less than sheer skulduggery, as you will see.
  
   To the business at hand, then. The three boys who call themselves The Legends are Numan Zaman Dipu, Shajib Sharkar and Mr. X, all of whom live in Dhaka, a small city on the bank of the Buriganga.
   
   Shajib Sharkar, who is small but wiry, is something of a scholarly type, although with an adventurous spirit. Numan Zaman Dipu is quite tall and muscular. Mr. X is—well, I shall refrain from giving you my own personal opinion of Mr. X. You will have to decide about him for yourself after reading the pages that follow. I shall simply stick to the facts.
   
   Therefore, though I would be surely tempted to call Mr. X fat, I will simply say, as his friends do, that he is stocky. As a very small child, Mr. X appeared in a television series about a group of comical children—a series I am happy to say I never encountered. However, it appears that as an infant he was so fat and comical in appearance, he was known as Baby Fatso and made millions laugh at the way he kept falling over things.
   
   This gave him a deep aversion to being laughed at. In order to get himself taken seriously, he studied furiously. From the time he could read, he read everything he could get his hands on—science, psychology, criminology, and many other subjects. Having a good memory, he retained much of what he read, so that in school his teachers found it best to avoid getting into arguments with him about questions of fact. They found themselves proved wrong too often.

Introduction

NOTICE TO THE READER

You are under no obligation whatever to read a single word of this introduction.

                                                                                                                    - FAHAD BIN HUSSAIN


I SEEM TO BE constantly introducing something. For years I’ve been introducing my stories. I’ve introduced my sites. And I’ve introduced books of mystery, ghost and suspense stories for my friends to shiver with.
  
  Now I find myself introducing a duo of lads who call themselves The Legends, and play football at 7 in the morning, taking bath in the pond, having every kind of fun you can imagine of, and studying 28 hours a day! Preposterous, isn’t it?
